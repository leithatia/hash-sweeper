# hash-sweeper
This Python application is designed to enhance cybersecurity efforts by scanning files for known malicious hashes. It cross-references each file in a specified directory against a list of dangerous hash signatures. Upon completion, the app identifies files containing these hazardous elements and provides a count of the number of matches found. This tool is useful for system administrators, cybersecurity professionals, or anyone needing to perform routine checks for compromised files.
